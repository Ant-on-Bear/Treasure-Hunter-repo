          OH NO!!!You had too much wrong guesses, now you are in jail. Normally
          it's a 2hour punishment, too see how long you still have too serve
          your punishment return to the dashboard and navigate too the game you
          were busy with, you will get a notification on the time you still have
          to wait, before continueing on your quest. Sorry...
